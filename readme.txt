== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the non-widget API? =

MiniPosts2 provides two functions, <code>is_mini_post()</code>, and <code>get_mini_posts()</code>. 

**<code>is_mini_post()</code>** - This function takes no arguments and can only be called from within the Loop. Returns *true* if the current post is a minipost, and *false* otherwise. 

**<code>get_mini_posts($format = null, $limit = null)</code>** - This function displays the existing miniposts. If either of the arguments are specified as non-null then the display is changed. The *$format* variable is used to specify a format, over-riding the values specified on the Options page.
